# CSS Snippet Cheat Sheet

In this project, I created a webpage that holds a collection of CSS snippets to help me learn CSS and recall important code snippets. 

## User Story

* As a user, I can view a collection of labeled CSS snippets in a responsive grid.

* As a user, I can easily identify these CSS snippets by their headings.

* As a user, I can highlight a code snippet by clicking on it.

* As a user, I can view my application on a mobile device as well as a desktop.

### Description and Specification

* Uses semantic HTML elements and proper indentation.

* Uses CSS variables to maintain clean and reusable values for a color scheme

* Uses flexbox, grid and media queries to create a responsive grid layout

* Each CSS snippet has a card-like layout with the CSS syntax wrapped in an HTML pre element

* Each CSS snippet can easily be highlighted for copying on click using the CSS user-select property

* Incorporates a background color using a CSS linear-gradient function

* Incorporates a bit of animation using the CSS transition property - card headings and text enlarge on hover
